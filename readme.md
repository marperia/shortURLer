# shortURLer

###This repo should stay here for the story

I would like to apologise to everyone who had to read that terrible code. I used to be small and stupid, but now I'm just foolish.

It's no longer maintainable (and never was). It's just a showcase what can I do with a new language or tech in 72 hours.

### Usage
```
go 
```
GET/POST request to <http://host:port/save/?url=XXX> and <http://host:port/get/?sha256=XXX>
